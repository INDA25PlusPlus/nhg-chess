- Pawn !
X Promotion: when it reaches the last rank (rank 8 for White, rank 1 for Black) become anything it wants ( queen, rook, bishop, or knight )
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_(chess) 
- The new piece does not have to be a previously captured piece
- Promotion is mandatory when moving to the last rank; the pawn cannot remain as a pawn. 

En passant: capturing a pawn that just moved two squares. (??)

- King !
Castling: moves two squares left or right if rook + king havenâ€™t moved, no check along the path.
