Pieces with normal moves only

Pieces with special moves
- Pawn
Promotion: when it reaches the last rank (rank 8 for White, rank 1 for Black).
En passant: capturing a pawn that just moved two squares.

- King
Castling: moves two squares left or right if rook + king havenâ€™t moved, no check along the path.
